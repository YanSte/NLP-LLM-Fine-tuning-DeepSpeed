This enables them to perform well in a variety of applications, as shown in previous modules. It is not uncommon though to find situations where applying a general purpose model performs unacceptably for specific dataset or use case. This often does not mean that the general purpose model is unusable. Perhaps, with some new data and additional training the model could be improved, or fine-tuned, such that it produces acceptable results for the specific use case.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/YanSte/NLP-LLM-Fine-tuning-Trainer/blob/main/img_1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n\nFine-tuning uses a pre-trained model as a base and continues to train it with a new, task targeted dataset. Conceptually, fine-tuning leverages that which has already been learned by a model and aims to focus its learnings further for a specific task.\n\nIt is important to recognize that fine-tuning is model training. The training process remains a resource intensive, and time consuming effort. Albeit fine-tuning training time is greatly shortened as a result of having started from a pre-trained model. \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/YanSte/NLP-LLM-Fine-tuning-Trainer/blob/main/img_3.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/raw/master/docs/assets/images/DeepSpeed_dark_transparent.svg#gh-dark-mode-only\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n\n\n[DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n1.

For example, some large LLMs having hundreds of billions of parameters making them too large to fit, in some cases, in available GPU memory. Models of this scale therefore need to leverage distributed processing or high-end hardware, and sometimes even both, to support training efforts. This makes large model training a costly undertaking, and therefore accelerating the training process is highly desirable.\n\nAs mentioned above, one such framework that can be leveraged to accelerate the model training process is Microsoft's [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00032.pdf). This framework provides advances in compression, distributed training, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and checkpointing.\n\nIt is worth noting that DeepSpeed is intended for large models that do not fit into device memory. The `t5-base` model we are using is not a large model, and therefore DeepSpeed is not expected to provide a benefit.\n\n\nThe intended use for DeepSpeed is in a distributed compute environment. As such, each node of the environment is assigned a `rank` and `local_rank` in relation to the size of the distributed environment.\n\nHere, since we are testing with a single node/GPU environment we will set the `world_size` to 1, and both `ranks` to 0.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"os.environ[\"MASTER_ADDR\"] = \"localhost\"\nos.environ[\"MASTER_PORT\"] = \"9994\"  # modify if RuntimeError: Address already in use\nos.environ[\"RANK\"] = \"0\"\nos.environ[\"LOCAL_RANK\"] = \"0\"\nos.environ[\"WORLD_SIZE\"] = \"1\"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>2 <span style='color:#78D118'>|</span> Fine-Tuning</b>\n\n### Step 1 - Data Preparation\n\nThe first step of the fine-tuning process is to identify a specific task and supporting dataset.
